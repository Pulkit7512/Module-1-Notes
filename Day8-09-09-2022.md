# Introduction of 2 - Dimensional Arrays
Previously we learned about 1- Dimensional arrays where we only have length and we can only travel either from left to right or right to left.
We can understand this by visualizing the 1-D array in the x-axis .Then the 2-D Array will be visualized in the x and y axis.
### 2-D Array
We can generalize a 2-D Array as a Matrix where we have some rows (m) and some columns (n) . The horizontal elementation is the row of the matrix while the vertical elementation is the column of the matrix.
The number of elements that can be stored in a m * n matrix is the multiplication of m and n.
Here m is the number of rows and n is the no of columns .

### Indexing in  2- D Array
In a 2-D array we have m rows and n columns , since we follow 0 based indexing in programming we the 1st row will be written as 0 th row and similarly the 1st column will be written as 0 th column.
So the Indexing for the rows will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 …. M-1  and the indexing for the columns will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 …. N-1.
### Locating an element in  2- D Array
In a 1-D array in order to locate an element we simply have to write down its index. But in a 2-D array in order to locate an element we have to get the row index as well as its column index, without any one of the row index and column index, it will be impossible to locate the element.
### Ways of initializing a 2- D Array
* Using a new keyword  : It will be similar to how we initialize a 1-d array ,instead of 1 square brackets we will use two square brackets and put row index in one and  column index in another.
int [][] mat = new int [m][n];
When we create a 2-d array in this way the rows and columns are fixed , that is for every row there will be “n” columns and the number of rows is also fixed.
* Using a curly brackets : we will use two sets of curly brackets to represent a 2-d array
int[][] mat = {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}};
When we create a 2-d array in this way , we have the flexibility of changing the number of columns for every row.This type of array is called a jagged array. For example:
int [] [] mat = {{1,2},{1,2,3}};
 This matrix has 2 columns in the 0 th row and 3 columns in the 1st row.

### Interpretation of 2- D Array
* We must interpret a 2-d Array as Array where at every index an Array is present ,that is an Array of length M where at 0 th index an array is placed whose length is N.
* *No of Rows in the Matrix : If mat is the variable name of the 2-d Array , the number of rows will be mat.length; 
//number of rows in a 2-d matrix
mat.length;

* No of Columns in the Matrix : we know that the number of columns can be different for every row , so for the column number we will first calculate the row for which we want to find the column number and then use the length property.
For example:
 //number of columns in 0 th row ;
  mat[0].length;

### Iterate over a  2- D Array and print the elements.
When we were iterating over a 1-d array we had a single pointer which is used to traverse over the indexes of the array ,Similarly here in 2-d array ,in order to iterate over the rows of the 2-d array , we will use a pointer and for every row ,in order to iterate over the columns we will use another pointer and the combination of both the pointers will help us iterate over every element of the 2-d array.
#### Algorithm
* For traversing over the rows of the 2-d array we will use a for loop which will start from i = 0 to the length of the 2-d array i.e i = mat.length .
* Now for every row we will traverse over all the columns .In order to do that we will again use a for loop to traverse from j = 0 to the number of rows present in that column i.e j = mat [ i ] .length.
* In order to print the element of i th row and j th column we will use mat[i][j] to print the values.

### Code Implementation
```java
int [][] car = new int [4][3];
for(int i =0; i< car.length ;i++){
   //i is telling the row  index
  
   for(int j =0; j< car[i].length;j++){
       //j is telling the column number
      
       System.out.println(car[i][j] + " ");
      
   }
   System.out.println();
}
```

# Q. Taking input in 2d Array and find the sum of all the elements
### Problem Statement:
First we have to create a 2d array and take input in that array. After this just calculate the sum of all the elements in the array.
### Example:
Input:-
m=5;
n=3;

[![Day8-09-09-2022.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MGbTS7Qx/Day8-09-09-2022.png)](https://postimg.cc/d73vRT6S)

Output:- 50+60+78+87+95+98+87+75+76+99+98+99+97+95+100
### Solution:
* Make a 2d array and take the input using two for loops which are nested. one for traversing on the rows and one for the columns.
```java
 Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
         int m= sc.nextInt();
         int n= sc.nextInt();
         int mat[][]=new int [m][n];
          for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){
            mat[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        }
```
* Then create a sum variable in which you will have the sum of all the elements in the 2d array.
* Take another two for loops for traversal on the 2d-array 
```java
 int sum=0;
         for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){
            sum+=mat[i][j];
        }
        }
```
* Now simply traverse over the array and keep adding each element in the sum variable.

### Code Implementation
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
         Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
         int m= sc.nextInt();
         int n= sc.nextInt();
         int mat[][]=new int [m][n];
         for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){
            mat[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        }
        int sum=0;
         for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){
            sum+=mat[i][j];
        }
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
        }
```

# Q. Sum of all elements on the principle diagonal
### Problem Statement:
Given a square matrix(square matrix means a 2d Array which has both equal number of rows and columns)find the sum of all elements on the principle diagonal.
### Example:
Input:
m=3;
n=3;

[![Day8-09-09-2022-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/qMPR20hZ/Day8-09-09-2022-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/1fKsZkKp)

Output:-
1+3+2=6
(here 1 is at (1,1),3 is at(2,2)and 2 is at(3,3))
### Solution:
* Create a 2d-Array and take input in the array.
* if (i,j) are indexes of elements at the principle diagonal then i=j.
* Then create a sum variable in which you will store the sum of all the elements in the principle diagonal.
* Take two for loops for traversal on the 2d-array.
* Put an if conditional that if(i==j) then that is the point which is a part of the principle diagonal.
```java
if(i==j){
            sum+=mat[i][j];
        }
```
* Print the sum variable.

### Code Implementation
```Java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
         Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
         int m= sc.nextInt();
         int n= sc.nextInt();
         int mat[][]=new int [m][n];
         for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){
            mat[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        }
        int sum=0;
         for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){
           if(i==j){
            sum+=mat[i][j];
        }
        }
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
        }
```

# Alternate Matrix Sum
### Problem Statement:
You are given a chessboard of size N x N, where the top left square is black. Each square contains a value. Find the sum of values of all black square and all white squares separately.
Remember that in a chessboard black and white squares alternate. 
### Example
Input: Input consists on N and the the numbers in the NxN matrix. You need to print out the sum of black squares and then white squares in the next line.

Output:
Output will be the sum of all the elements in the shaded region and unshaded region separately. 
### Solution
* Create a 2d-Array and take input in the array.
* Use two nested for loops to traverse over the 2d matrix.
* Now analyze the question, it has been told that first sqaure is black.It means that the squares at which i+j is even are black and the sqaures which are i+j is odd are white.
* So put an if conditional if ((i+j)%2=0) which means i+j is even then add the value to sum of black sqaure and if ((i+j)%2=1) which means i+j is odd so add it to white square sum.
* After the loop ends print the value.

### Code Implementation
```java
public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int n = sc.nextInt();
      int [][]mat = new int[n][n];
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
          mat[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
        }
      }
      int blacksum = 0;
      int whitesum = 0;
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
          if((i+j)%2==0)
          {
            blacksum+=mat[i][j];
          }
          else
          {
            whitesum+=mat[i][j];
          }
        }
      }
      System.out.println(blacksum);
      System.out.println(whitesum);
	}
