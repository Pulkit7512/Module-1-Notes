# Searching a number in an Array
### Problem Statement :
Given an Array arr of N elements and an integer K .We have to print the position of first occurrence of K in the given array.
### Example:
if we want to search 16 in an array {12,3,4,16,7,16,2,16,8}  where 16 is occurring 3 times ,we have to return the first occurrence of 16, which is at index 3 but we do not have to print the index, we have to print the position which is (index +1). and if we did not find the target in the array we will print -1;
### Solution:
* We will create a int variable ans initialize it with -1 so that if we did not find the index we are looking for we will print -1;
* In order to search whether the element is present or not we will iterate over the array with the help of a for loop.
* Inside the loop we will check if the i th element of the array is equal to the target or not .
* if the element is equal to the target we will update our ans variable with the index of the element, that is “ i ” and will break over the loop because we need the first occurrence of the target element.
```java
for(int i =0 ; i<  n ;i++){
   if(arr[i] == target){
       ans =i;
       break;
   }
}
```
* And if we did not find the element we will continue with the loop.
* When we exit the loop and if the ans is not equals  to -1 ,it means we have found the index of the first occurrence of the target element , we will print the position which is (index+1).
```java
if(ans != -1){
    System.out.println(ans+1);
}else{
    System.out.println(ans);
}
```
* And if ans is equals to -1 we will print -1.

###  Code Implementation:
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = sc.nextInt();
int target = sc.nextInt();
int [] arr = new int[n];

for(int i =0;i<arr.length;i++){
   arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
}
int ans = -1;
for(int i =0 ; i<  n ;i++){
   
   if(arr[i] == target){
       ans =i;
       break;
   }
}
if(ans != -1){
    System.out.println(ans+1);
}else{
    System.out.println(ans);
}

# Reverse an Array
#### Problem Statement :
Given an Array arr of N elements we have to reverse the elements of the array.
#### Example:
if we are provided  an array {1,2,3,4,5,6}  we have to reverse the elements of the array and make it { 6,5,4,3,2,1 } .
#### Solution:
* We will create two pointer variables ,that is i and j and initialize i as the starting index of the array and j as the ending index of the array 
* Now  i =0 and j = arr.length -1.
* We will use this pointer to move forward with the help of i and move backwards with the help of j
* We will use a while loop in which the condition will be while( i <  j ) and we will swap the element at i with the element at j and then increase the i  pointer and decrease the j pointer.
```java
while(i < j){
   int temp = arr[i];
   arr[i] = arr[j];
   arr[j] = temp;
   i++;
   j--;
}
```
* Swapping is done by storing one element ,let's say the element at i th index in a temp variable and then updating the i th element with the jth element and updating the j th element with the temp variable we created.
* Finally when we exit the loop we will get the reversed array.

####  Code Implementation:
```java
int arr [] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
int n = arr.length;
int i =0 ;
int j =arr.length-1;
while(i < j){
   int temp = arr[i];
   arr[i] = arr[j];
   arr[j] = temp;
   i++;
   j--;
}
for(int k =0 ;k < n ;k++){
   System.out.print(arr[k] + " ");
}
```

# Divisible sum Pair
### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers and a positive integer k, determine the number of (i,j) pairs in the array where i<j and arr[i]+arr[j] is divisible by k.
In other words:
We will be given an array of integers and a number K. We have to tell whether the array can be divided into pairs such that the sum of every pair is divisible by K and the first integer in the pair should be smaller then second.
### Example:
arr={1,2,3,4,5,6} k=5 Three Pairs meet the criteria: [1,4],[2,3] and [4,6]
1+4=5
2+3=5
4+6=10
all of them have sums which are divisible by k=5.
### Solution
* Take input of n elements,k and an array arr using scanner.
* Make a count variable which will take count of the number of pairs.
* Next step will be to take two pointers i and j in two  nested for loops and since i<j so j will start from i+1 always. i will travel from 0 to arr.length and j will travel from i+1 to arr.length;
```java 
int count =0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    for(int j<i+1;j<n;j++){
        
    }
}
```
* Next step will be to write the condition using 'if' conditional and every time we encounter that sum of element at ith index and elements at jth index is divisible by k then we increment the count. 
```java
if(arr[i]+arr[j]%k==0){
    count++;
}
```
* After the loop ends just print count.
### Code Implementation
```java
Public static void main(String args[]){
Scanner s = new Scanner (System.in);
int n= s.nextInt();
int k=s.nextInt();
int arr[]=new int [n];
for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    arr[i]=s.nextInt();
}
int count =0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    for(int j<i+1;j<n;j++){
        if(arr[i]+arr[j]%k==0){
             count++;
        }
    }
}
System.out.println(count);
}
```

# For-each loop
For-each loop basically means that for every integer x belonging to arr the following action will occur.
It basically helps to traverse directly on the array elements rather than the index.
```java
int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6};
for(int x:arr){
   // action
   System.out.println(x);
}
```
output:
1
2
3
4
5

# Max Element in an array
### Problem Statement:
You are given an array and you have to find the maximun element among all the elments.
### Example:
int arr[]={1,5,3,7,2,6};
output:7
### Solution
* Taka an array as input.
* Declare a max variable to store the max element till each point. Store the first element as the potential maximum element.
* Traverse on the array using a for loop and if you find a element which is greater then the max,in that case you will update the max varible and store that particular element in the max variable.
* when the loop ends you will have the max element stored int the max variable.
### Code Implementation
```java
int arr[]={1,5,3,7,2,6};
int max=arr[0];
for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    if(arr[i]>max){
        max=arr[i];
    }
    System.out.println(max);
}
```
