# Switch Cases
We all have used the chain of if else blocks,in these blocks we write a certain condition and based on that whichever block satisfies that condition , that block is executed and we never enter in the other blocks.

To remove the complexity of the if else chaining , switch cases are used which are similar in functionality to the if else cases.

# Switching  Variable
The variable which decides which case will be executed is called the switching variable,  Only three types of variables are permitted in switch cases which are int,char and String.
For example
Let's take a  if else statement and try to convert it to a switch case.
```java
    int a =5;
	if(a ==10){
	    System.out.print("inside if a = 10 ");
             	}else if(a == 5){
	    System.out.print("inside  if a = 5");
                     
	}
```
This code snippet shows a if else statement where the else if (a == 5) will be executed because a is equals to 5
Now let’s try to convert it to a switch case 
Here the value of a will be the switching variable and each case will check whether it is equals to 5 or not, if it is equal, the code inside that case will be executed and break keyword is used to break out of the loop.
```java
int a =5;
        switch(a)
        {
            case 10 : System.out.print("inside case 10");
                    break;

            case 5 : System.out.print("inside case 5");
                   break;

        }
```
Here the parentheses of switch syntax contains the switching variable and all the cases check strict equality to this switching variable,if it is true it will execute that case.
# Default case:
In a if else chain , whenever we use else block, that block is executed when none of the if ,else if  blocks are true, similarly we use default cases in switch case , which is executed when none of the case statements are true.
# For Example:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	    int a =100;

        switch(a)
        {
            case 10 : System.out.print("Inside case 10");
         break;
            case 5 : System.out.print("Inside case 5")	;
          break;
            case 15 : System.out.print("Inside case 15");
		break;
            default:System.out.print("Inside default case");
        }
	}
	//Output : Inside default case
```
# Free Fall in switch case:
We have noticed that in every case statement ,we have used the break keyword, so that whenever  we hit the valid case statements and execute its code ,we will break out of the case statements.
If we remove that break statement , whenever we hit the valid case , every case after that case will execute till the end , this is known as freefall.

For example:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	    int a =5;

        switch(a)
        {
            case 10 : System.out.println("Inside case 10");
            case 5 : System.out.println("Inside case 5");
            case 15 : System.out.println("Inside case 15");
            case 20 :System.out.println("Inside case 20");
            default:System.out.println("Inside default case");
        }
	}
	//output:Output:
        Inside case 5
        Inside case 15
        Inside case 20
        Inside default case
```
# Calculator using Switch Case:
We will be given two variables x and y and a char operator among + , - , *, / and based on the operator we we have print the calculated value using switch cases
Solution :
* We will take two integer inputs x and y and a char input op which is the operator.
```java
int x = scn.nextInt();
int y = scn.nextInt();
char op = scn.next().charAt(0);
```
* In the switch block we will write the operator input from the user and based on the operator we will do the operations on the variable.
* In cases we will have ‘+ ‘, ‘ - ’,’  * ’, ’ / ’ and in those cases we will do these operations and print the result.
```java
case '+':
   System.out.println(x + y);
   break;
case '-':
   System.out.println(x - y);
   break;
case '*':
   System.out.println(x * y);
   break;
case '/':
   if (y == 0) {
       System.out.println("Div by 0 is not possible");

   } else {
       System.out.println(x / y);
   }
   break;
```
* And if we did not find any valid operator we will print “Please read manual ” in the default case.
```java
default:
   System.out.println("Please read Manual");
 ```
# Code Implementation:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CalculatorUsingSwitchCase {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
       int x = scn.nextInt();
       int y = scn.nextInt();
       char op = scn.next().charAt(0);

       switch (op) {
           case '+':
               System.out.println(x + y);
               break;
           case '-':
               System.out.println(x - y);
               break;
           case '*':
               System.out.println(x * y);
               break;
           case '/':
               if (y == 0) {
                   System.out.println("Div by 0 is not possible");

               } else {
                   System.out.println(x / y);
               }
               break;
               default:
                   System.out.println("Please read Manual");
       }
       System.out.println("Happy serving you");
   }
}

```
# Passing String in a Function:
We all know that strings are immutable in nature, we can change the string , and even if  we add something at the end of the string , changes are not done on the original string, a new string is created with the changes in it and now the variable starts pointing it at the new string,

Considering this fact , Let’s see and example :
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
   String s  = "Hello";
   addY(s);
   System.out.println(s);
}
public static void addY(String s){
   s+="Y";
   System.out.println(s);
}
//output:HelloY
//       Hello

```
When we called the addY function , a context of function is created which has a copy of string s as its argument which is equal to “Hello”, this function add Y at the end of the string, what actually will happen is a new string will created as “”HelloY” and now the s will start pointing to that new String. The print statement will print HelloY and its execution will be over, once the execution is over , the context of the string will be deleted and in the main function when we print the input string s , it will print “Hello” because the string with y added to it was destroyed when the context of the function got deleted.

In order to reflect  the changes in the original string we will have to the return the output from the addY function and update our variable s with the returned string as follows:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
   String s  = "Hello";
   s= addY(s);

   System.out.println(s);
}
public static String addY(String s){
   s+="Y";
   return s;
}
// Output :
//  HelloY
```
# Q. Factorial of a number
### Problem Statement:
Given a number n find the factoria of the number
Factorial of n means n*(n-1)*(n-2).....till 1.
### Example:
input:3
output:6
### Solution:
* First we take an input for a number n.
* Then we create a function which calculate the factorial of a number.
* The ans could be a large value so we will keep the return type as long.
* Inside the function make a for loop which runs from n to 1. create a variable and multiply the
values one by one to the variable.
* remenber to intialize the variable from 1 as because if you initialize it from zero then anything multipled by zero is zero.
* return the variable and catch the value in another variable by calling the factorial function inside main and  print it.

### Code Implementation:
```java
public class Main
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		//your code here
                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
                int n = sc.nextInt();
                long ans = fact(n);
                System.out.println(ans);
                
	}
        public static long fact(int n)
        {
               long ans = 1;
                for(int i=n;i>=1;i--)
                {
                        ans =ans*i;
                }
                return ans;
        }
}
```

# Q. Calculate ncr
### Problem Statement:
you are given two integers n and r.
Calculate ncr which means calculte n factorial,n-r factorial, r factorial the ncr is euqual to n!/r!*(n-r)!
### Solution:
* Take input for two numbers n and r.
* create a factorial function as created in the previous question.calculate n factorial by calling the factorial function and passing n, calculate r factorial by calling the factorial function and passing r and lastly calculate n-r factorial.
* store all the values that we get by calling the factorial function in different variables.
```java
                long x = fact(n);
                long y=fact(n-r);
                long z=fact(r);
```
*  now calculate ncr in the main fucition itself.print the answer.
```java
public class Main
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		//your code here
                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
                int n = sc.nextInt();
                int r= sc.nextInt();
                 long x = fact(n);
                long y=fact(n-r);
                long z=fact(r);
               
                long ans= (x)/(y*z);
                System.out.println(ans);
                
	}
        public static long fact(int n)
        {
               long ans = 1;
                for(int i=n;i>=1;i--)
                {
                        ans =ans*i;
                }
                return ans;
        }
}
```
##### Time Complexity:O(n)
##### Space Complexity:O(1)
### Alternate Method:
* Just create another fucntion in main function in which we do all the calculations.rather than doing it in the main. 
* create a function which takes n and r as input and passes them to the factorial function and its return type should also be long.
* it calculates n factorial by calling the factorial function and passing n, calculates r factorial by calling the factorial function and passing r and lastly calculates n-r factorial.
* Now it will do the calculation for ncr and return the ans to main.
```java
public static long ncr(int n, int r)
        {
                long x = fact(n);
                long y = fact(n-r);
                long z = fact(r);
                long ans = (x/(y*z));
                return ans;
                
        }
```
* now the main will only call this new function that does all the calculations and then it will print the and.
```java
public class Main
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		//your code here
                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
                int n = sc.nextInt();
                int r = sc.nextInt();
                long ans = ncr(n,r);
                System.out.println(ans);
                
      
	}
        public static long ncr(int n, int r)
        {
                long x = fact(n);
                long y = fact(n-r);
                long z = fact(r);
                long ans = (x/(y*z));
                return ans;
                
        }
        public static long fact(int n)
        {
               long ans = 1;
                for(int i=n;i>=1;i--)
                {
                        ans =ans*i;
                }
                return ans;
        }
}
```
