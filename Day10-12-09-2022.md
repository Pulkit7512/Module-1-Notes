# Introduction to String
A String is a non-primitive datatype or you can say a string is an object in java. It is called so because it is a collection of multiple characters.
# String Initialization
we can initialize a string in two ways:
* The first way is to hardcoding:
```java
String s="abcde";
//inside the double quotes is your string literal
```
* Second way is to use 'new' keyword:
```java
String s=new String ("hello");
```
# Various functions of a string
* s.length(): It returns the length of the string. 
* s.charAt(n): Returns the character at the specified index(n).
* s.indexOf('ch'): Returns the index of the first occurrence of character ch in the string if not found then -1 is printed.
* s.indexOf('ch',n): Returns the index of the first occurrence of character ch after the index n in the string if not found then -1 is printed.
* s.indexOf("//substring"): Returns the first occurrence of substring
* s.indexOf("//substring",n): Returns first occurence the substring after the index n.
* s.toUpperCase(): Converts string str to upper case
* s.toLowerCase(): Converts string str to lower case

* s.replace('ch','another ch'): returns a new string in which ch is replaced with another ch. Similarly you can replace a substring with another string. 
* s.split("str"): Splits the string and returns the array of substrings that matches the given regular expression.

#### Substring
* It is a continuous part of a string.
* str.substring(start,end): Returns a new string which is a substring of str beginning at start and extends to end-1.The end index is exclusive here.

* ac or bd in the above image cannot be a substring because they are not continuous.
 
### Taking input in a string
Input in string is taken in two types:
 ```java
 import java.util.*;
public class main{
public static void main (String args[]){
    Scanner s=new Scanner (System.in);
    String t=s.nextLine(); //it will read input untill it gets a new line
}
}
```
```java
 import java.util.*;
public class main{
public static void main (String args[]){
    Scanner s=new Scanner (System.in);
    String t=s.next(); //it will read input untill it gets a space or a new line.
}
}
```
##### Note: There is no specific way to take char input using scanner.In this case we tak a string input of one length and later convert it to char usimg charAt.
```java
import java.util.*;
public class main{
public static void main (String args[]){
    Scanner s=new Scanner (System.in);
    String t=s.next(); 
    //"a";
    char a=s.charAt(0);
}
}
```
# Immutable nature of the string
Once the string is created you cannot make any changes in the string except we can concatenate a string.
In string concatenation a brand new string is created and the older string startsa to point to this brand new string.
Basically, whenever we are doing some changes in the string so it a means a new string is created with those changes refected in it.
```java
import java.util.*;
public class main{
public static void main (String args[]){
    String str="abcde";
    str+="fghi"//a new string is created as "abcdefghi" and str will now point to this new string.
    System.out.println(str);
    //output= "abcdefghi"
}
}
```
# diffrence between (==) and (.equals)
this (==) compares the addresses or references of the string while .equals compares the values of the strings.
# Memory Mapping in strings
If we create Strings using string literals then the strings are created in string pool and in a string pool if same string is created again then it does not create a new string instead it just points to the same reference that is of the older string which is already present in the string pool.
```java
import java.util.*;
public class main{
public static void main (String args[]){
    String p="abcd"; //strings created using literals so they are created in string pool
    String q="abcd";
    System.out.println(s==t);//output is true because both the strings are pointing to 
    same address
    System.out.println(s.equals(t));//output is true because both the strings have same value
}
}
```

If we create a string using 'new' keyword then the string is created in the heap memory.Everytime when the 'new' keyword is used then a new string is created at a diffrent location or address.
```java
import java.util.*;
public class main{
public static void main (String args[]){
    String s=new String ("hello"); //strings created using literals so they are created in string pool
    String t=new String("hello");
    System.out.println(s==t);//output is false because both the strings are pointing to   different address
 System.out.println(s.equals(t));//output is true because both the strings have same value
}
}
```
