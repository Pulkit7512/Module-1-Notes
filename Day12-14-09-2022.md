# Introduction to Functions 
If we look into mathematics , what functions are , functions are used to process the input that we provide ,and give the desired output after processing.
Similarly functions are used to do operations which may or may not take an input and may or may not give us an output but it does some processing which is useful for us.

# Why do we use Functions ?

The question arises that ,even if we were not having functions ,we used to do  the processing and operations . So why do we need functions to do the same task?.
Functions are created for the reusability of code, the code that we have written is doing some operations or processing some data to create a desired output. If we want to do that operation again in future, we have to write that piece of code again and again. And if in future we find out the code that we have written is incorrect, we have to go to all the places and change the code.
For the reusability of code and removing redundancy in our code , functions are introduced in programming.
In programming we follow the DRY principle which means “Do not Repeat Yourself”.


# How do we use Functions ?

Let's take an example, if we create an application, In order to create an application we have to write hundreds  of Thousands of  lines of code. 
If we have to write the code to find the weather forecast of a place and we have to write this code multiple numbers of times,instead of doing that we will create a function which contains the code to find the weather forecast of a place and wherever we want to find the weather forecast,we will simply call this function. This follows the DRY principle and dictates the reusability of code.
And even in the future we want to modify the logic of weather forecast , we simply have to modify the function and not have to worry about going to all the places where this function is called.


# How do we write a Function ?
 
In mathematical functions  we  take some input and provide some output, this fact will help us write a function in java

Let's take  an example of a function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 5.
This function requires a variable x as an input and returns an integer value after processing the data. Based on this example the signature of a function will look like :
```java
public static int  f ( int x ) {

int ans = x*x +2*x+5;

}
```
We will learn about public and static keywords in OOPs ,  the int after the static keyword defines the type of the output which will be returned by the function. We call it the return type. And the “ f ” represents the name of the function followed by parentheses which contains the input required in the function followed by curly brackets in between which we write the logic for processing the input to convert it to desired output.

# Scope of a  Variable.

Scope of a variable determines the visibility of the variable , that is  the scope in which we can access a variable.
Scopes are of two types: 

* Block level Scope : if we define a variable inside a block , the accessibility of that variable will be within that block only ,we can not access that variable outside the block.
A block is nothing but a space between opening and closing curly brackets such as if statements , loops ,etc.
For example :
If we declare a variable inside an if statement , we can not access it outside the if block, it will give an error .
```java
if(true)
{
   int a = 5;
   System.out.println(a); // within the scope
   if(true){
       System.out.println(a); // within the scope
   }
}
System.out.println(a); // outside the scope , it will give error
```
* Function level Scope : If a define a variable inside a function , the scope of that variable is inside the function only, even in the  some block statements which are within the function, variable is accessible within those block statements , but it can not be accessed outside the function 
For Example: 
If we declare a variable in the main function and create another function , we cannot access the variable from the main into the other function
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a =  5; 
        System.out.println(a); // within the function scope
        
        if(true){
            System.out.print(a); // within the function scope
        }
    }
    public static void f(){
        
        System.out.println(a); // outside the function scope
    }
}
```
# Execution of a  Function.

The start of execution of any programme is the main function. And through the main function we call all the other functions.when a function is called , a context of the function is created and the execution in the main function stops and the execution of the context created starts and once the function is fully executed,the context of the function is deleted.

Inside the main function , in order to call a function we write the name of the function followed by parentheses in which we pass the arguments if any and then a semicolon.
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Inside main function ");
        
        //calling printGreeting function
        printGreeting();
    }
    public static void printGreeting(){
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
//Output :Inside main function 
     //   Hello
```
In the above example we can see that the main function started the execution of the program and inside the main function we called the greeting function and it got executed.

# Termination of a  Function.

A function is terminated in two following conditions.
* Every line of code in the function is done with its execution.

* Return statement is called . Even if we have not executed every line of code inside the function , the moment when we hit the return statement , the function ends its execution and returns the value via return statement.

### Example :
```java
public static void printGreeting(){
   System.out.println("Hello");
  
  if(true){
      return;
  }
 
  System.out.println("hello again");
}

```
This function will not be able to execute the last  print statement because the function will stop its execution when it will hit the return statement in the if block.
# Calling a Function inside a Function.
When we call a function inside a  function ,  for example in main function  we call a function  f1 ( ) , a context of function f1 will be created and will start getting executed and no execution in main function will be there until the f1 function ends it execution , similarly in f1 function if we call a function f2 context of f2 will be created and it will start getting executing and till then f1 will wait for f2 to complete its execution.

#### Code Example :
```java
public class FunctionInsideAFunction {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Inside main function");
       f1();
   }
   public static void f1(){
       System.out.println("Inside function f1 ");
       f2();
   }
   public static void f2(){
       System.out.println("Inside function f2");
       f3();
   }
   public static void f3(){
       System.out.println("Inside function f3 ");
   }
}
//output:Inside main function
//       Inside function f1 
//       Inside function f2
//       Inside function f3
```
#  Pass by Value in java
 When we call a function in order to perform certain operation and we pass the input to the function , we doest pass the actual input , we pass a copy of the input value, and if the return type of that function is void , the changes done on th copy of the input will never get reflected to the original input value and hene in order to reflect the change we have to return the value in which we have made changes.

#### For example : 

if we have a cup  and we have to print something on the cup , in order to do that we will call a function to print on the cup,and since we pass a copy of the cup ,if the return type is void , after printing on the cup , the will also get deleted once the context of the function is deleted, and hence we can not see printing on the original cup.
So in order to reflect the changes on the original cup ,the function will return the cup which is printed and the non printed cup will be replaced by the printed cup.


# Function to increment
* Suppose that we have to write a function to increment the value so we will pass an interger variable and the fuction can call the integer variable anything irrespective of what the main function calls it and inside the function we will just increase the integer variable.
* Everytime when the fuction is called in the main, the function will increase the value of the integer that it gets from the main.
*After that if we print the value of a in the main function we will get the incremented value as our output.
```java
public class main{
public static void main(String []args){
    int a=5;
    increment(a);
}
public static void increment(int a){
    a++;
        System.out.println(a);
}
}
//output:6
```
* if we just call the function in the main and then we print variable 'a' it will print 5 because original value is not getting changed because we are simply printing the variable and it is present at a different location.we are just sending the copy of the variable in the increment method.
```java
public class main{
public static void main(String []args){
    int a=5;
    increment(a);
    System.out.println(a);
}
public static void increment(int a){
    a++;
}
}
//output:5
```
* Now if we change the return type of the fuction and return an int to the main then it will catch the value and it will print 6.
```java
public class main{
public static void main(String []args){
    int a=5;
   int ans= increment(a);
   System.out.println(ans);
}
public static int increment(int a){
    a++;
return a;
    
}
}
//output:6
```
# Sum of n natural numbers
### Problem statement:
For an integer n your task is to calculate the sum of first n natural number.
### Example:
input:5
output:15(1+2+3+4+5)
### Solution
* Take input for a number n using a scanner
* write a function which will calculate the sum of n natural numbers and return the and to the main function in the form of an integer.
```java
public static int sumOfNaturalNumbers(int n)
    {
    }
```
* in that function run a loop from 1 to n and add the sum in a variable named sum.
* At the end return the sum.
* In the main function call the 'sumOfNaturalNumbers' and pass the variable n.Store the value which comes from the function in a variable and print that variable.
```java
     int ans = sumOfNaturalNumbers(n);
      System.out.println(ans);
```
### Code Implementation
```java
public class Main
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		//your code here
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int n = sc.nextInt();
      int ans = sumOfNaturalNumbers(n);
      System.out.println(ans);
      
	}
    public static int sumOfNaturalNumbers(int n)
    {
      int sum=0;
      for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
      {
        sum+=i;
      }
      return sum;
    }
}
```

# Q.Last index of one
### Problem Statement
you are given a string as input and you have to return the last index at which 1 occurs.
### Example:
input:"01001"
output:4
### Solution:
* Take input of a string.
* Make a function which takes string as an input and return the integer value which is the index of the last occurrence of 1.
* In the function run a loop which will start from the end of the string since we have to find the index of the last occurrence of 1 so we will travel from last index and return the first occurrence of 1.It is the same thing.
```java
for(int i=t.length()-1;i>=0;i--)
      {
        if(t.charAt(i)=='1')
        {
          return i;
        }
      }
```
* as soon as you encounter a 1 return the index.
* call the function from the main and store the value in a variable and print that you receive.
```java
     int ans = lastIndex(s);
      System.out.println(ans);
```
### Code Implementation
```java
public class Main
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		//your code here
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String s = sc.next();
      int ans = lastIndex(s);
      System.out.println(ans);
	}
    public static int lastIndex(String t)
    {
      for(int i=t.length()-1;i>=0;i--)
      {
        if(t.charAt(i)=='1')
        {
          return i;
        }
      }
      return -1;
      
    }
}
```
