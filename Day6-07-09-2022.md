# INTRODUCTION TO ARRAYS

### Why do we need Arrays?

If we are asked to store the marks of let’s say 100 students it will be not  feasible to store it into primitive data types and maintaining 100 different variables is a tedious process.
So in order to make the maintainability easier and keep the data organized, arrays are introduced.

### Arrays

An array is a collection of items of the same data types stored at contiguous memory locations
This is the diagrammatic representation of an Array. Where the data in an array can be retrieved with the help of indexing

Note: The indexing in programming starts from 0 and not 1, so the first element is at index 0 , the second element is at index 1 and so on.
We can see in the above diagram for an array of size 6 the index starts from 0  and ends at 5.

### Initialization of an Array

Whenever we are initializing an array we need to specify two things :
* The data type that we are going to store in the array, we cannot store multiple data types in an array.At the time of creation array stores default values. For Example : for an array of integers the default value is 0 ,for boolean array the default value is false and so on.

*  The length of the array is the number of elements we are going to store in the array. Length is a trait or property of an array which tells us the number of elements in an array.

### Memory allocation of an Array

Whenever we initialize an array of size n , a space is reserved in the heap memory for this array, suppose we we create an array of data type int of size 5 , certain amount of memory is reserved in the heap which is if we calculate , 1 int data type requires 4 byte of memory ,so for an array of size 5 , 5 * 4 = 20  Bytes of  memory are reserved in the memory.

Arrays are non-primitive data types , wherever we initialize an array naming arr, the arr is referencing a memory location which is created in the heap which will store elements of certain data types.

### Operation on an Array

* Accessing an element in Array : we can access an array by writing the name of the array with opening and closing square brackets and inside the brackets, we write the index of the element we want.
 If we try to access the index which is not within the length of the array we will get an error.

* Insertion in Array :  In order to insert an element in a particular index in an array we have to specify the name of the array and in square brackets the the position at which we want to insert element at and then equate it with the value of the element.
If we try to insert value at an index which is not within the length of the array we will  get an error.

### Ways of Initializing an Array
* Using the new Keyword :
 int [] arr = new int [ n ] ;
* Using the curly brackets :
int [] arr = {1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 }; 

### Traversal over an Array
If we want to traverse over an array we will go from index 0 to index 1 to index 2  …. index n-1 for an array of length n.
So what is changing here are the indexes , in order to do that we will use a simple for loop and change the indexes every time
```java
int [] arr={0,1,2,3,4,5};
for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    System.out.println(arr[i]+" ");
}
```
In the for loop we are simply traversing from index 0 to 1 index less than the length of the array and printing it everytime.
 
### Take Array Input from User
* We will create a Scanner object and take an integer n as  input for the length of the array.
* Then we will create an array of size n 
* For taking the input of the elements of the array we will traverse over the array and for every index we will take the input with the help of scanner object
```java
Scanner sc=new Scanner (System.in);
int n= sc.nextInt();
int []arr= new int[n];
for(int i=0;i<arr.lenght;i++){
    arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
}
```
### Print the Array in a Single Line
We will use a for loop for traversing over the array and for printing the elements of the array in a single line .We will use System.out.print() instead of using System.out.println().
```java
for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
}
```
### Sum of all element  in Array
In order to get the sum of all the elements present in the array:
* We will create a sum variable and initialize it to zero
* Then we will use a for loop to iterate over the array
* For every iteration we will add the value of the element into the sum variable that we have created.
* And finally after we exit the loop we will print the sum.
```java
int sum=0;
for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    sum+=arr[i];
}
System.out.println("Sum of all elements in an array is "+sum);
```
### Average of all Elements in an Array
In order to calculate the calculate the average of all the element we should divide the sum of all the elements with the total number of elements.
* Calculate the sum of all the elements 
* Create a double variable for storing the average . We are making it double because the average may come in decimal places.
* Divide the sum of the array with the length of the array and store it in the average variable.
* Don’t forget to typecast sum variable to double because the right hand side is a int and the average variable is a float.
```java
double average = (double) sum / arr.length;
System.out.println("The average of all the elements in an array is " + average);
```
### Fraction of +ve , -ve , and 0  in Array
We have to find the the fraction of the positive number  ,  negative number and of the zeros present in the array.
* First step is to count the number of positive numbers , negative numbers and zeros in the array.
* We will create 3 variables for storing the count these values that is countPos, countNeg, countZero.
* Now iterate over the array and check if the number is positive if it is then increase the count of the countPos variable similarly if it is a negative number increase the count of negative numbers and if zero increase the count of countZero.
* Now in order to calculate the fraction of positive numbers we divide the countPos with the length of the array and we do the same to calculate the fraction of negative numbers and zeros .
```java
int countPost=0;
int countNeg =0;
int countZero=0;
for(int i =0;i<arr.length;i++){

  if(arr[i] == 0){
      countZero++;
  }else if(arr[i]<0){
      countNeg++;
  }else{
      countPost++;
  }
 
}
System.out.println("The fraction of positive numbers is " + countPost/arr.length);
System.out.println("The fraction of negative numbers is " + countNeg/arr.length);
System.out.println("The fraction of zeros  is " + countZero/ arr.length);
```
