### Solution:
* If we try to visualize the pattern in terms of the row we are is,when we are at 0 th row the numbers of spaces is 0 and the number of stars are 5 ,similarly for 1 st row the number of zeros are 1 and number of stars are 4 and going down at last row i.e, 3 rd row the number of spaces is 3 and the number of star is 1.
* So we take N as the number of rows ,and we iterate from i = 0 to i < n ,we can conclude that the number of spaces will be equal to i and the number of stars is equal to (N -  i) .
* Hence we the outer loop will go on from i =0  to i < n and for every iteration we will print i spaces and n-i stars
```java
for(int i =0 ;i < n ; i++ ){
```
* So inside the outer loop we will write one loop for printing the spaces i.e, from j = 0  to j < i.
```java
for(int j = 0 ; j < i ;j++){
   System.out.print(" ");
}
```
* And one more loop inside the outer loop for printing the stars and a space  from j = 0 to j < N - 1.
```java 
for(int j = 0; j < n-i ;j++){
   System.out.print("* ");
}
```
* And finally we will use a println statement for changing the line after completing one row.


### Code Implementation: 
```java
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = scn.nextInt();

for(int i =0 ;i < n ; i++ ){

   //loop for printing spaces
   for(int j = 0 ; j < i ;j++){
       System.out.print(" ");
   }

   //loop for printing stars

   for(int j = 0; j < n-i ;j++){
       System.out.print("*");
   }
   //for changing row
   System.out.println();
}
```

# Print all Prime Numbers in range from 1 to N.

### Problem Statement : 
 You will be given a number N . You need to print all the prime numbers that are there in the range from 1 to N (both inclusive).
A prime number is a number which only has two factors i.e, 1 and no. itself.

### Solution:

* In order to print the prime numbers between  1 to N , we will use a for loop  to traverse over all the numbers and check if it's a prime number or not.
```java
for(int i =2; i <=n ;i++){
```
* Now for a number to be a prime number it should not be divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself. In order to achieve that , we will use one inner loop which will travel from j=  2 to one number before itself and check if it is divisible by any of the numbers between the range.
```java
for(int j =2;j<i;j++){
````
*  If we found out that the number got divided among this range , it is not a prime number and we will break out of the loop.
* In order to judge whether the loop has ended naturally or the break statement has  ended it , we will use a flag variable . we will initialize it with false and once we find out that the number is not a prime number we will set it to true.
```java
if(i % j ==0){
   flag=true;
   break;
}
```
* Hence after the inner loop if the value of the flag is still false it means the number is  a prime number and we will print the number.

### Code Implementation: 
```java
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
int n =scn.nextInt();
for(int i =2; i <=n ;i++){
   boolean flag=false;
   for(int j =2;j<i;j++){
       if(i % j ==0){
           flag=true;
           break;
       }
   }
   if(flag ==false){
       System.out.print(i +" ");
   }
}
```
### Optimisation :
We can optimize our solution based on evidence that we will find all the factors of a number n before the root of n (N ^1/2) .
For example : if we take 16 we can factorize it as 1 * 16 ,2 * 8 , 4 * 4,  8 * 2 , 16 * 1. Here we can see the factor before the root of 16 i.e, 4 are 1, 16 , 2,8,4 and after that all the factors are repeated.
  This means that even if run our loop before and equals to the root of n we will get the factors.
```java
for(int j =2;j*j<=i;j++){
```

### Optimized Code :
```java
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
int n =scn.nextInt();

for(int i =2; i <=n ;i++){

   boolean flag=false;

   for(int j =2;j*j<=i;j++){

       if(i % j ==0){
           flag=true;
           break;
       }

   }
   if(flag ==false){
       System.out.print(i +" ");
   }
}
```

# Max Product of Two Elements in an Array.

### Problem Statement: 
Given the array of integers arr of size N , you will choose two different indices i and j of that array. 
Return the maximum values of (nums[ i ] -1 ) * (nums [ j ]-1).

### Solution

* In order to find the max product of two numbers we need to first find the maximum and second maximum number in an array.
*  To find the max and second max we will initialize two variables max1 and max2 with Integer.MIN_VALUE.
```java
int max1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
int max2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
```
* Now we will iterate over the array and will check if the arr[i] is greater than or equal to  max1 . if it is greater we will update the max2 with max1 and max1 with the arr[i].
```java
if(arr[i] >= max1){
   max2=max1;
   max1=arr[i];
}
```
* The if condition will be followed with an else if condition stating whether the arr[i] is greater than or equal to max 2. If it is greater than the max2 we will only update the max2 with the arr[i].
```java
else if(arr[i] >= max2){
   max2=arr[i];
}
```
* Now we have max and second max with us, we will create an ans variable and initialize it with (max1-1) * (max2-1) , and print the ans variable.

### Code Implementation: 
```java
Public static void main(String args[]){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = sc.nextInt();
int [] arr = new int[n];

for(int i =0;i<arr.length;i++){
   arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
}

int max1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
int max2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

for(int i =0 ;i< arr.length ;i++){
   if(arr[i] >= max1){
       max2=max1;
       max1=arr[i];
   }else if(arr[i] >= max2){
       max2=arr[i];
   }
}

int ans = (max1-1) * (max2-1);
System.out.println(ans);
}
```

# Print Pyramid of Numbers:

### Problem Statement : 
You are given N representing the number of rows , you have to print the given star pattern.

### Solution:
* If we try to visualize the pattern in terms of the rows ,when we are at 1 st row the numbers of spaces is 4 and the number of number is 1 ,similarly for 2nd  row the number of spaces are 2 and number of number are 2 and going down at last row i.e, 5 th row the number of spaces is  0  and the number of numbers are 5.
* So we take N as the number of rows ,and we iterate from i = 1 to i <= n ,we can conclude that the number of spaces will be equal to N-1 and the number of numbers is equal to i .
```java
 for(int i =1 ;i <= n ; i++ ){
 ```
* Hence the outer loop will go on from i =1  to i <= n and for every iteration we will print N- i spaces and i numbers and the number will be the row at which we are currently at.
```java
for(int j = 1; j <= i ;j++){
```
* So inside the outer loop we will write one loop for printing the spaces i.e, from j = 1  to j < = n - i.
```java
for(int j = 1 ; j <= n-i ;j++){
   System.out.print(" ");
}
```
* And one more loop inside the outer loop for printing the number and a space  from j = 1 to j < = i .
```java
for(int j = 1; j <= i ;j++){
   System.out.print(i +" ");
}
````
* And finally we will use a println statement for changing the line after completing one row.


### Code Implementation: 
```java
Public static void main(String args[]){
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = scn.nextInt();

for(int i =1 ;i <= n ; i++ ){

   //loop for printing spaces
   for(int j = 1 ; j <= n-i ;j++){
       System.out.print(" ");
   }

   //loop for printing numbers

   for(int j = 1; j <= i ;j++){
       System.out.print(i +" ");
   }
   //for changing row
   System.out.println();
}
```

# Extra Questions
### Problem Statement : 

Sam has an array arr and an integer k ,he wants to find all the indices of k  in array and print them in ascending order.

### Solution:

* Since we travel the array index in ascending order, we do not have to do any extra thing to print the index in ascending order
* We will iterate over the array and check if the arr[i] == target
* If it is equal to the target we will print the index with a space.
* Else we do not have to do anything ,this time we do not break the loop after finding the target ,because we are interested in all the indices.

### Code Implementation: 
```java
int [] arr = {5,6,3,4,5,69,5,68,4};
int target = 5;

for(int i =0 ;i< arr.length; i++){
  
   if(arr[i] == target){
       System.out.print(i +" ");
   }
}
```

#### Space Complexity - O(1)

### Problem Statement : 

Take a user input  n .
Now the task is that you need to print all the numbers in the range [1,n]
(both inclusive) such that the number is either divisible by 2 or divisible by 5 both not both.

### Solution:

* We will iterate from 1 to the number n (inclusive) 
* For every iteration we will check if the number is either divisible by 2 or divisible by 5 with the help of or( || ) operator
* And inside this if statement we will check whether the number is divisible by both 2 and 5 with the help of and  (&&) operator .If it is so we will just continue.
* Else we came into a block which is only divisible by either of 2 and 5 and not with both
So we will print this number


### Code Implementation: 
```java
Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
int n =scn.nextInt();

for(int i =1;i<=n;i++){

   if(i % 2 ==0 || i % 5 ==0){

       if(i % 2 == 0 && i % 5 ==0){
           continue;
       }else{
           System.out.print(i +" ");
       }
   }
}
