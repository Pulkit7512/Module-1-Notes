# Time And Space Complexity
### How to judge the quality of the code : 

The naming convention and styling of the code are something which shows the nature of the coder , while this factors are not the main parameters based on which we judge the quality of the code,

The Quality of the code is judged by the time taken by the code to implement its functionality and also the space it consumes to do the operations.
Since we have limited memory , the less the space a code takes, the ideal the code looks like.

For example : If a person A and person B writes the code to find the prime number , if code of A takes 3 sec and code of B takes 10 sec , we will also prefer the code which takes less time and has faster execution , similarly ,since the space is limited we want the programme to occupy less memory,

This is the reason why we use Time and Space as the parameters to check the quality of the code.

### Should we compare Absolute Runtime and Absolute Space :

We took a example where A and B have written code to find the prime number ,and the code of A took  3 sec while Code of B took 10 sec to generate the output,
Can we say that code of A is better than code of B based on time complexity?
NO
We can not say that , we cannot compare absolute runtime of the code , this is because of 2 factors :

* Input size : The input size may vary for both the codes and as the input size increases the time for generating the output will take a larger time compared to smaller inputs.

* The Environment of the code written also defines the time taken for the execution of the code, faster processor or new device will run the code faster as compared to slower processor and older device.

Similar to the absolute time , we can not judge the quality of the code based on the  absolute  space the code requires, because of the same two reasons i.e., the input size and the environment in which we write the code .


### Time Complexity

The time taken by the program to run as a function  of input size . Rather than giving the absolute time to run a function , it gives the proportion of time for a code to execute when the input is increased.

For Example : if a take a code , in that  for input size of n =2 , the time taken to execute the code is 2 sec , for n =3 , its 9 sec for n =4 , its 16 sec , this shows that the Time is directly proportional to n ^2 , where n is the input size.
Based on this proportion we  will judge which code is better.

With the help of this graph we can easily judge  which code is better in terms of time taken for its execution.

#### Pseudo Code 1 Time Complexity :

In the above code, the first and last line does depends on the input passed by the user, it will always run one one time, while this this for loop will run depending upon the number of inputs,
For Example : if we take n =10 , the loop will run 10 times  ,if we take n as 1000 the loop will run 1000 times, this shows that the time complexity is proportional to  n , which is the number of input.

#### Pseudo Code 2 Time Complexity:

[![Day14-16-09-2022-7.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/G2SKms2F/Day14-16-09-2022-7.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/dkrrW3G3)

In the above code  , we have a nested loop . In the outer loop for  i =0 , the inner loop runs n times. For i =1 , the inner loop runs n times ,so on and so forth.
So n iterations are done for every outer loop and the outer loop runs n times ,making the time taken by the programme directly proportional to n ^2 .

#### Pseudo Code 3 Time Complexity : 

[![Day14-16-09-2022-5.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/sDPWnhrT/Day14-16-09-2022-5.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/7f6bhbbz)

In the above code  , we have a nested loop . In the outer loop for  i =0 , the inner loop runs n times. For i =1 , the inner loop runs n times ,so on and so forth.f
So n iterations are done for every outer loop and the outer loop runs m times ,making the time taken by the programme directly proportional to n * m .

### Space Complexity

The space taken by the program to run as a function  of input size . Rather than giving the absolute space to run a function , it gives the proportion of space used  for a code to execute when the input is increased.

#### Pseudo Code 4 Space  Complexity : 

[![Day14-16-09-2022-4.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W3y81Pyh/Day14-16-09-2022-4.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/vgWf0Cbs)

In the above code there are two variables n and a, which will be consuming 4 bytes of memory  each , and once the memory is used it does not vary with the input size. And hence the space complexity is constant and does proportionate to the input size.
Whereas if the input size defines the  length of the array , the size of the array is defined by the input size taken. This shows a linear relationship between space and input size.
Hence the space complexity is directly proportional to n .

### Asymptotic Notation

>Big O Notation : Worst Case Complexity 

>Omega Notation :Best Case Complexity

>Theta Notation :Average  Case Complexity


### Linear Search 
We will analyse all the Asymptotic Notations using various input we can give to implement a linear search.
In linear search we iterate over the array and check if the element at the current index is equal to the target , if it is equal , we will print that index and return the index , and if we did not find the target at the end of the iteration we will print -1.
Now let's discuss the Asymptotic annotations based on the input provided for linear searching.

>Best Case : The best case for linear search is when we find the target elements at the starting of the index, the complexity of searching for the best case will not depend on the input size , we will always find the target element at 0 th index.
And hence the complexity will be omega of 1 , omega because it's the worst case and  1 because it's constant and does not vary with input size.

>Worst Case : The worst case for linear search is when the target element is not present in the array, we will iterate through the whole array and will not find the element, the complexity of searching for the worst case will be Big O(N) , Big O  because it's the worst case and  N because the time taken for the execution varies with the input size linearly.

>Average Case :  The average case for linear case is that we find the target element somewhere in the middle of the array and hence will take n/2 iteration to find the target element.
Based on this , the average time complexity will be theta of n/2 , theta because it is an average case and n/2 because time taken to search an element is directly proportional to n/2 iterations.


### Pseudo Code 5 Time Complexity :

In the above loop the inner loop will run  i times , that is for i = 0 , the inner loop will run n times , for  i ==1 ,the inner loop will run 1 times ,for i==2, the inner loop will run 2 times , so no and so forth ,till i=n-1 , where the inner loop will run n-1 times
If we take the summation of all these 1+2+3+4+........+n-1 = ( n-1 )(n-1 +1) / 2.
When we open the brackets we will see that it is equal to n^2 /2 - n /2 , for larger value we ignore the constants and smaller power of n.hence the time complexity will bt equal to O(n ^2).

### When i gets divided or multiplied by 2 after every iteration:

* you can see in the image that after every iteration n becomes half so the time complexity when the loop runs in this manner will be O(log n).
* whether it an array or string etc. anything you can do half and so on then the time complexity will be O(logn).similar as shown in the figure.(here log is of base 2 because it gets divided by 2 everytime)
```java
for(int i=n;i>=1;i/=2){
    
}
```
* similarly if a number gets divided by m then tim complexity will be O(log n)where log has base m.As shown in the fig below.
[![Day14-16-09-2022-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/1tWDnMmq/Day14-16-09-2022-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/34vkzXD8)

```java
for(int i=n;i>=1;i/=m){
    
}
```
* the order time complexities from less time taken to more time taken will be O(log n)<O(n)<O(n^2)<O(n ^3)
* Now similarly if i*=2 then also the time complexity will be O(log n) base 2.

### O(1) time complexity(constant time)
Basically an algorithm has o(1) time complexity if it takes same time regardless on size of the input or the number of input.
Example:
> finding the sum,multiplication,division substraction of two numbers,maximum between two numbers,swapping two numbers etc.

### Time complexity to iterate over the matrix
Suppose there is a matrix of m rows and n columns and we have to visit each point in the mattrix so the time complexity will be  O(m*n).
Example:
rows=m
columns=n
```java
for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
        
    }
}
```
In the above example the complecity will be O(m*n) but in the example below i travels to n cells but j is traveling in multiples of two so the complexity if i is O(n) and j is O(logn).the complexity of the total trraversal is O(nlogn).
Note: In case of nested loops you just multiply the inner and the outer complexity.
```java
for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<n;j*=2){
        
    }
}
```
### Overall time complexities in increasing order of time consumption
O(1) < O(logn) < O(n^1/2) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) <O (n^3).....

# Given the code tell the time and space complexity

### Code-1

```java
int a=0;
int i=n;
while(i>0){
    a+=i;
    i/=a;
}
```
here since i is getting half after every iteration  so the time complexity will be O(log n).
Now talking about the space complexity the final value stored by a will be sum of the geometric progression which is n+n/2+n/4+n/8.....1. because the half of the previous value is getting added in every iteration
on solving this gp you get the space complexity as O(2n).As shown in the fig below.
